# Adversarial Examples of Pokemon
Implementation of Adversarial Examples using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network (DCGAN), PyTorch as DL framework using the given kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset. Used 100x1 dimension latent space variable as input to the network to finally generate adversarial / fake pokemons.
Discriminator Training highest value of D(x) = 0.9996 i.e. we can say our network works and can generate highly accurate adversarial examples of pokemon.
