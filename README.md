# DCGAN_Pokemon
* The implementation of DCGAN using PyTorch to generate pokemons from random noise. Dataset was taken from Kaggle:- https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset
* Here we have used DC-GAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network) to generate the fake pokemons using 100x1 dimension latent space variable (random noise).
